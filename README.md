#### Things Learned:-

- [children property of the prop](https://github.com/im-ashish00/react-portal/blob/886a1890fa0782afa5983619c326ea22980a81a3/src/Modal.jsx#L4)
- [what portal is?](https://github.com/im-ashish00/react-portal/blob/886a1890fa0782afa5983619c326ea22980a81a3/public/index.html#L10)
- [Portal helps us to make our component render separately from the parent element](https://github.com/im-ashish00/react-portal/blob/886a1890fa0782afa5983619c326ea22980a81a3/src/Modal.jsx#L25)
- Portal has event delegation built in and it persists the parent child relations even tho it's rendering it outside it.
